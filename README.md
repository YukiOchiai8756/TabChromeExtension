# TabChromeExtension
A simple chrome extension that notifies you when you have too many tabs open


# Release Date
2022-11-06

# Things to keep in mind when using
1. Check that your computer settings allows notifications from google chrome
2. Check from 'chrome://flags' that 'Enable system notifications' is set to 'Enabled'

# Limitations
Setting the notification type to 'image' is deprecated in the current version, therefore
the notification is rather dull. Hoping for future patches to allow notification type 'image'
for mac OS.
